# Unscrambler
Unscramble words and find anagrams

### Overview
Ever had trouble coming up with the right scrambled word? What if you found a possible English word, but it is the incorrect one and you're too mentally exhausted to find another?

Use *Unscrambler*-- it's dictionary of 355,000 English words will quickly find solutions for all sorts of unscrambling games. In addition, it can easily check if a word exists, find anagrams, and there is an unscrambling game included!

*Unscrambler* is very bare-bones and is probably my only project without any CSS styling-- it's not the prettiest, but it's quick and light.
